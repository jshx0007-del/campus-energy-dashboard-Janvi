# campus-energy-dashboard-Janvi

# Objective:
The main objective of this project is to analyze and visualize electricity consumption data from multiple buildings in order to:
- Combine energy usage data from multiple sources
- Clean and validate real-world CSV data
- Perform daily and weekly energy aggregation
- Generate building-wise summary statistics
- Visualize consumption trends using charts
- Export results and generate an executive summary report

This project demonstrates the practical use of:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

# Methodology:
The project follows a 5-step structured methodology:
1. Data Ingestion & Validation
2. Core Aggregation Logic
3. Object-Oriented Modeling (OOP)
4. Data Visualization (Matplotlib)
5. Data Export & Executive Summary

# Insights:
From the analysis performed:
- The project successfully identifies the highest energy-consuming building
- Peak load time is detected using timestamp analysis
- Daily and weekly consumption patterns help in:
    - Identifying high-demand periods
    - Understanding building-wise energy behavior
- Visualization makes it easy to:
    - Compare buildings
    - Spot peak demand hours
- This type of analysis can be applied in:
    - Universities
    - Corporate campuses
    - Smart city energy management systems

# Conclusion
This project successfully analyzes electricity consumption data using Python by performing data ingestion, aggregation, visualization, and reporting.
It helps identify peak load times and high-consuming buildings through clear statistical summaries and graphs.
The use of OOP and automation improves code structure and efficiency.
Overall, the project provides a practical foundation for real-world energy monitoring systems.
